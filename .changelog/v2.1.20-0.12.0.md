Kotlin version: `v2.1.20`

> [!warning] Refactored
> Some of this was refactored in #93:
> - Module splitting
> - Gradle Plugin API changes: deprecated `suspendTransform { ... }` and a new Gradle Property API-based `suspendTransformPlugin { ... }`
> 
> For more, see #93 .
> 
> Although after some testing, the generated code is consistent and compatible before and after the configuration migration, but after all, there are a lot of changes, so please pay more attention to it. 
> Please feel free to provide feedback if you have any questions!
